Prerequisites
Python 3.x (preferably the latest version)
pip (Python package installer)
Steps
Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system, download it, and follow the instructions to install it.

Verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a terminal (or command prompt) and typing python --version. You should see the version number of Python that you just installed.

Install pip, the package installer for Python. To do this, open a terminal (or command prompt) and type python -m ensurepip --default-pip. This will install the latest version of pip.

Clone or download the source code for the Flask app from its repository.

Navigate to the directory where the source code is located in the terminal.

Install the required Python packages by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all the necessary packages for the Flask app.

Start the server by running the command python serve.py. This will start the Flask app and make it available at http://localhost:8080 (assuming that the server is running on your local machine).

Test the app by sending requests to the API endpoints /v1/chat and /v1/transcribe using an appropriate HTTP client such as Postman or cURL.

When you are finished testing, stop the server by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal where the server is running.

That's it! You should now be able to run the Flask app on your local machine. For more information on how to use the app, refer to the documentation in the README.md file that is included with the source code.
